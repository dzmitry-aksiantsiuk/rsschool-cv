## Summary

I am an aspiring front-end developer. My goal in this course is to study the main aspects of this field of activity and learn how to use all the necessary tools. I have been working as a system administrator in computer networks for 5 years and decided to expand my horizons and develop the necessary skills in the most interesting area of the IT-industry in my opinion as a frontend development. I hope to get a job in this field in the future and join a close-knit, purposeful team.
